# Invidious-fullwidth.css

## Why

I needed a big player for coding along, so you dont have to zoom in or zoom out too much and without having to go fullscreen.

Stylus css for making [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) site's and player full width to your browser window.

Apply:

1. Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)

2. Click [file](https://github.com/debpalash/Invidious-fullwidth.css/raw/main/Invidious-fullwidth.user.styl)

Features:

* Full window width player gets even bigger with ratio
* Site thumbs and content uses full width
* Top multiple instances support, you can add or edit your own

Compatibility:

* Chromium based
* Firefox not tested
